Genetic Algorithm code for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This code implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) â€” a classic optimization challenge where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a list of cities exactly once and returns to the starting point. The algorithm simulates natural selection by evolving a population of possible routes through selection, crossover (breeding), and mutation. Over multiple generations, the population improves, converging toward an optimal or near-optimal solution. The final output is the shortest path found and a plot showing how the solution improved over time. It's a powerful demonstration of evolutionary computing in action.
